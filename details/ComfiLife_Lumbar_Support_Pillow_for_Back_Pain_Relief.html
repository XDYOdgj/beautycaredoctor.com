			var commentsList = [{"user":"C. Momot","content":"I bought this, because I was having tons and tons of back pain / sciatica, for months, even though I had just bought a new mattress. My new mattress was very supportive (medium firm), but it was a little bit too hard, I guess. I was spending a ton of money on the chiropractor and on massage therapy, with no discernible improvement, because even though I\u2019d feel better after the treatment, every night I would go back to sleep on the same mattress, and it would mess up my back again, by morning. It was costing me a bundle.I bought this pillow, because I was getting desperate, and didn\u2019t want to have to toss my expensive mattress, yet again! So, I thought I\u2019d give this a try. I live in Canada, and this is one of the only lumbar sleep pillows that would ship up there, directly. So, I paid a lot in direct shipping costs, but in the end, it was 100% worth it.At first, it was really stiff, and, for the first month, or so, it was actually bothering my back - the pointy part in the centre was just irritating things even more, and I was feeling really dismayed. In retrospect, I now know that this was because it hadn\u2019t been broken in yet. You have to be patient with this product, and give it some time.Rather than return it, and waste my money, I decided to use it under my knees for a few weeks, and, over time, I noticed that it gradually softened up. So, at that point I tried it on my back again, and lo and behold, it was like a different pillow! Ever since then, it\u2019s been working extremely well for me and I absolutely love it! I now have excellent lumbar support, it doesn\u2019t hurt me anymore, and my back/sciatica pain has gone away.I find that I do have to adjust it, quite a bit, to get it in the right spot, and it tends to slide around sometimes, while I am sleeping, because I roll around a lot. So, every night I just put it back to where I want it, before I go to sleep.I would say that you have to give it about a month, or two, of putting weight on it (as I said, I would recommend using it under your knees at first), so that the pointy domed part softens up, and, then, at that point, it\u2019s really great. I would buy this again without any hesitation, and I fully recommend it. For me, it\u2019s been a lifesaver! I would like it even better if it was a little bit longer, so that is a suggestion I would make the manufacturer \u2013 just to maybe lengthen it by about 6 to 10 more inches (length only - the width is fine), but that\u2019s a very minor point.","purchase_model":"Size: Standard Color: White  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2020-05-22 15:48:11"},{"user":"Carol","content":"Something\u2019s don\u2019t work out but this one did.I was waking up every morning with pain in spine and hips for several weeks but after first night of using this product I woke up with no pain. I have an expensive memory foam mattress and I think it was not supporting my back where it should anymore. This simple support has saved me a whole lot of money.","purchase_model":"Size: Standard Color: White  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-01-05 15:48:11"},{"user":"Les Brinkley","content":"This is hands down the BEST Lumbar support pillow on the market!!!! Spinal alignment while sleeping is the goal of any lumbar support pillow. People, PLEASE stop WHINING if the flawless alignment it provides doesn't eliminate your back pain!!! Lower lumbar spinal disorders are complex, and more often than not, if some degree of relief is not achieved from a support pillow such as this, there's a more serious spinal issue that should be addressed by a medical professional......OK...had to get that off my chest.Let me articulate why I feel this is an amazing product. Let's start with the thickness and firmness of this pillow. Many pillows claim to be made of memory foam, but there are plenty of them made of foam material that's not authentic memory foam. I own an expensive, medium-firm Tempurpedic mattress, and this pillow is truly made of the same memory foam as my mattress. For $27 bucks, that alone makes it a tremendous value. Genuine memory foam will NEVER lose its original shape! This is why it comes with a lifetime warranty, and that's another reason it's a tremendous value!Concerning the thickness, there are several alternative products available that come with foam pads that can be added to the pillow to adjust the height. Many complain that this lumbar pillow isn't thick enough, and as such, it doesn't deliver adequate support. I totally disagree and hear's why. There's very minimal elevation required in the lower lumbar region to properly align the spine while sleeping, regardless of sleeping on your back, side, or stomach. Too much elevation, in fact, can cause more problems than those that may already exist. I'd imagine that most reviewers that complain about this pillow not providing enough support are owners of very soft mattresses. No lumbar support pillow can make alignment corrections when placed on a mattress that's not firm enough already for a certain individual.Lastly, let me touch on the cover, portability, and size of this pillow.The cover material is soft, heat-resistant, removable, and washable.The pillow comes with a nice transport case that allows you to fold it and protect it should you decide to take it on the road.My favorite feature is actually the width of the pillow. I'm a big guy and at 27 inches, it allows me to lay on my back and turn to either side without having to lift up and adjust the position of my body, or the pillow.That's a big deal because excessive movement disrupts one's ability to stay in a deep sleep.Hopefully this review will help you make an educated decision on purchasing this excellent product.","purchase_model":"Size: Standard Color: White  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2023-02-26 15:48:11"},{"user":"Chula Girl","content":"My back was killing me every morning but I ordered this pillow and my back has not bothered me at all.This pillow can also be used a few other ways.

An injury left me with lumbar scoliosis and I could not lay on my left side for more than ten seconds without severe pain. Now I can lay in any position while sleeping without pain. At first I had to loosen up before bed so my back would easily take the contour of the pillow. Now I easily sleep with it every night and bring it with me when I travel.","purchase_model":"Size: Standard Color: White  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-02-08 15:48:11"},{"user":"Kimberly M Lutz","content":"If you are a side sleeper, this is a must have!
