It has the ideal height to keep me comfortable throughout the night. The pillow holds its shape incredibly well, giving consistent support every night.It\u2019s firm enough to provide good support but also squish-able.It really is the perfect density of memory foam.I had a question about the pillow and reached out to the company.Their customer service team is amazing and very responsive. Any questions or concerns are handled promptly and professionally.They are the reason I decided to write a review. Highly recommend","purchase_model":"Style:  3.25&#034;H Super Slim Max Cool (Standard) Style: 3.25&#034;H Super Slim Max Cool (Standard)  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-02-04 15:48:11"},{"user":"Placeholder","content":"I first discovered Bluewave pillows several years ago because of cervical spine issues I developed. For me, they\u2019ve been nothing short of a blessing! A complete game-changer because of the neck alignment support they provide.A very dear friend of mine has developed issues with his cervical spine, as well. I decided to order two of these pillows for him. Now my friend loves them, too! He\u2019s been sleeping on them for about a week now and is so surprised about how much better he can sleep with these.He\u2019s already forwarded the Bluewave pillow order info (on Amazon, of course!) on to yet another friend to order after hearing my friend\u2019s rave reviews!In addition to the great neck support and comfort they provide these are also cooling.In summary, excellent quality, comfort and durability. They are so worth the price.

It's cool to the touch. It showed up with a few drops of water & dried out very quickly .... just as the description notes.It's very comfortable like a memory foam pillow but seems a little softer to me. Though not so soft my head/neck didn't feel supported. I am 5\"3\", 124lbs & work in the construction industry. Sleep is extremely important to me because I don't get much of it in my line of work. Quality sleep is more important than just closing my eyes & I've had the same pillow for a couple years. I managed to smash it pretty flat but it really looks like it needed a good washing. After ruining my last washing machine washed pillow I was hesitant but it needed to be done, so I took a leap. It was ruined & I knew it as soon as I took it out of the washing machine. I hoped the dryer would fluff it up evenly & I'd just have to sleep on a puffy pillow for a week or 2 until it smashed down but it dried lumpy just like it came out of the washing machine. It was no good. I ordered this pillow based on the thickness I thought I'd prefer & this pillow has so far been about perfect.I might wish it a bit thinner but that might be too thin & I really needed a perfect pillow. This nailed the job. Because of the material, I never have to wash it & now that I've found one I like, I'll continue buying from this brand. Even my husband who seemed to love his Memory Foam pillow that came as a gift with our Tempurpedic Cloud Supreme bed thinks he too will be switching to a thinner pillow. He's 6'3\", 210 & feels his current, standard size pillow is too lofty.I was in a car accident 4 years ago & prior to that slept soundly on a latex pillow that breathed very well & had hols in it like this to keep the user cool. I loved that pillow but after the accident couldn't sleep on it anymore & have been on the hunt for a thinner pillow with similar support. I finally found my new perfect pillow. I bought this pillow in Super Slim max cool standard size. It is slightly smaller all around than my previous pillow but my previous pillow was too but for me anyway so why would I expect the new, better one to be the same size & better any better? A smaller pillow overall, for me, was the ticket. The Super Slim may be my next pillow but so far, this one has helped me get a better sleep & my neck doesn't hurt anymore.I use a pillow cover then put my pillow case on but this pillow comes with a cover. Even still, I've left it on & use my own over that so my laundry consists of 3 pillow cases off my single pillow. I feel like it keeps the pillow clean though I shower daily. I think it just makes me feel better.The seller is spot on about everything in the description. In my opinion, I didn't feel there was a \"chemical\" smell with the new pillow. I think what people smell is \"new\". It's like when you buy a new hoodie. It has that new clothing smell & pillows are no different. We just aren't typically used to the scent of new memory foam. I really didn't smell anything I couldn't sleep on the same night I received the pillow. I left it uncovered for the day to dry out. Not that was soaked. Just a few drops on the case as mentioned in the description, & it was completely dry by the time I got home late afternoon. I put the original case it came with back on, my own pillow cover & my pillow case. It's a perfect-for-me pillow. I'd definitely order another pillow from this seller. They were transparent & the product arrived quickly & exactly as described.","purchase_model":"Style:  3.25&#034;H Super Slim Max Cool (Standard) Style: 3.25&#034;H Super Slim Max Cool (Standard)  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2020-11-11 15:48:11"},{"user":"K","content":"This pillow literally eliminated all my back and neck pain! It\u2019s well worth the price! It helps keep your spine aligned, even if you are a side or stomach sleeper.

I am 25 and have suffered with back pain between my lower shoulder blades at my spine for the last 3 years. The pain had gotten so bad that I could not sit for longer than 30 minutes without having spasms. I got a 3 inch memory foam mattress and while it helped relieve some symptoms like my legs and arms falling asleep and lower back aching, the sharp pain in the middle of my back persisted. I had the best of the claimed best thick memory foam pillow. On a whim I decided to sleep without the pillow when one day I laid down and immediately felt the shooting pain. So I have been sleeping without a pillow for 2 weeks and the back pain was GONE, finally!!! But it feels weird sleeping without a pillow, where does you arm go? It was hard for me to fall asleep without a pillow, but I continued to not use one because atleast my back didnt hurt anymore. So I bought the thinnest memory foam pillow I could find, which was this pillow. Omg is it amazing. I fell asleep INSTANTLY with it, I slept so hard and felt so refreshed. And finally no more back pain. 25 years of thinking im only 25 how can I be in this much pain, all cured by this pillow.The packaging and directions are wonderful. The pillow case is awesome (except for tag placement but easy to remove). The pillow is actually SUPER cold and stays pretty cold. There is a cold side and non cold side. I sleep on the non cold side and it still stays fairly cool, but the underside is very cold which is nice to put your arm under when feeling hot. If you have learned no pillow cured your pain, then get this pillow so you can fall asleep fast again. And if you have random middle of the back pain thats sharp and feels like it needs to crack 24/7 might I suggest a 3 inch memory foam for your mattress and this pillow.","purchase_model":"Style:  2.25&#034;H Hyper Slim Max Cool (Standard) Style: 2.25&#034;H Hyper Slim Max Cool (Standard)  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-08-20 15:48:11"},{"user":"Andrew Martin","content":"At first I bought their slightly bigger one at 2.25 inches and I loved it but it still wasn't quite meant for me.
