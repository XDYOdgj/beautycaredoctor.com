			var commentsList = [{"user":"Cate","content":"Finally a perfect side sleeping pillow. I stay on my side and don't snore. My neck isn't misaligned so I don't wake up with a stiff neck anymore, either. The pillow is so soft and my head and neck don't get all sweaty. I really like the slight curve and that it was available in King to fit my pillow cases. It's firm yet soft. I don't imagine it will go flat as every regular pillow eventually does. It fluffed up fully in a couple of hours after unboxing. As some others noted, it does have a slight 'weird' odor. I think it's the filling material. I don't notice it unless I stick my face into it, as when turning over. I'm fairly sensitive to odd smells. I might suggest adding an essential oil to the pillow under the case to mask it; something calming. The price is worth the comfort and relief and you'll get better rest. What is that worth?","purchase_model":"Size: King Size (1 pack) Color: Crescent White  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-01-07 15:48:11"},{"user":"Patti R.","content":"I started having problems with my neck. I havearthritis and using a high pillow was causing me problems. This pillow is great! First of all I love crescent shaped cut out in the front. The pillow comes in a standard size but it's adjustable! It comes with a bag of foam if you need it higher. It also has a zipper to take out all the foam you need to give you the right height, firmness & flexibility! It is awesome & I will be getting more! It has a cooling side as well. The foam is small pieces of memory foam cut in small pieces so you can really position it to your liking. This was a great price & it is washable. Best decision I've made in a long time!","purchase_model":"Size: Queen Size (1 pack) Color: Crescent White  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-12-05 15:48:11"},{"user":"StephanieT","content":"I have been searching for THE pillow for what feels like forever and finally found the perfect pillow. I have paid over a $100 for a tempur-pedic pillow. Used that one for a week trying to make it work- NOPE.I am a side sleeping human flipping- flopping- twisting- blanket wrestling machine. What a huge difference it made. I'm now getting much more sleep and here is why. The pillow has that perfect mix of firm and soft. As a side sleeper, the shape makes more sense for snuggling around me while giving my neck the support needed.When I opened it- I was concerned because what a stinker. I quickly banished it to another room in hopes that airing it out would remedy the problem. It took about 2 days- perhaps helped along by my impatient application of fabreeze.Highly recommend- in fact a few weeks later I shared my happiness with a family member who immediately went on Amazon and bought one for herself. Today I asked how she liked it but she said she was still airing it out. Don't let that stop you from getting this amazing pillow.

It perfectly aligns under my neck and above my shoulders, which has significantly improved the quality of my sleep. The way it supports my neck keeps me comfortable all night and has greatly reduced the stiffness I used to feel in the morning.","purchase_model":"Size: King Size (1 pack) Color: Crescent White  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-01-13 15:48:11"},{"user":"Dale Rachmeler","content":"This is just what I wanted to have. It is difficult to order pillows online as it is the kind of thing you want to touch and feel. I took a leap and went with with shredded foam pillow. The thing I really like is that you can adjust the amount of foam in it either making it firmer or taking foam pieces out to get it to be less firm. It has an outer pillow cover with a long zipper and an inner cover with a shorter zipper. It took a couple of days to get it right but I am very pleased with the results. There was no strange odor nor any another defects. I am very glad to have this pillow.","purchase_model":"Size: Queen Size (1 pack) Color: Crescent White  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-02-12 15:48:11"},{"user":"HBKAT92647","content":"I fell 2 years ago place trash in a dumpster. The owner had not repaired potholes and I twisted my ankle and did a 360 against a brick wall.I have no money for medical care and it appears I have herniated my disc's, done permanent nerve damage that runs down my right arm and gets numb and in pain.It takes me an average of 4-6 hours before I be free of pain.I can no longer drive more that 15-30 minutes.I cannot tolerate sitting beyond an hour.I can no longer handle an 8 hour day working on a computer.This event has changed my life.I never slept with pillows but I finally realized I required a pillow to support my neck and back.I bought a medium tempedic pillow which works when laying on my back but not so much for side sleeping.This pillow has allowed me to sleep on my side again.I tried it on my back and I am still dealing with how much fill should be in the pillow.Initially I removed some of the fill and this did not support my head and sank causing the pinched nerves to stain and cause terrible pain.I re-added the fill and this allowed me to be okay when sleeping on my side.I like the way this cradles my head when sleeping on my side.Once in a while I have used it to sleep on my back but I have to pushed the pillow under my shoulders so my head is supported and not tilting into my chest.I alternate between this pillow for side sleeping and the tempedic pillow for back sleeping.It took about 3-4 days to allow the smell to go away.I also feel the manufacturer should sell it with a pillowcase as this adds to the expense.I am hoping in time the relief of the pressure will allow my pinched nerve and herniated disc's to heal but it has been past 2 years and I don't see much improvement.So I will need a pillow like this just feel somewhat able to handle just normal basic function.If you have pinch nerves, herniated disc's and have a whiplash injury this will definitely help you if you are a side sleeper.Just know you will need 2 other pillows to support your back and arm.Note the I ordered the King Size Pillow.Do not buy the smaller pillow it will not work as it will be too small for the with of your shoulders and arms.I gave it 4 stars because it comes without a pillowcase and you cannot really use it for back sleeping as it tilts your head forward exasperating and irritating whiplash injury.Update September 2024:This pillow has relieved the herniated and punched nerves.I am finally waking up pain free.I use this pillow to sleep on my side and this cradles my head.It is my favorite pillow and once in a great while I may use the tempedic pillow a little bit but this is the pillow that has helped me so much.I have added the stars to 5 bc this is a true miracle and my gratitude cannot be measured.I am telling everyone I know about this pillow.Buy it if you work with computers and have neck or whiplash injuries.You need to give it time and place the pillow behind your neck when you sleep on your side.This will give you relief and you will wake up pain free.","purchase_model":"Size: King Size (1 pack) Color: Crescent White  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-08-01 15:48:11"},{"user":"ASim","content":"I am a side sleeper and I\u2019ve been looking for a pillow to help with the shoulder pain I get from sleeping on my side. The curved feature does seem to help. This pillow also gives you the option to add or remove the stuffing so that you can adjust it to your preference. And, it has a cooling side that really feels cooler. I don\u2019t notice much of a difference with a pillowcase on it but I definitely can feel the difference without one on it. As an added bonus it came in a 2 pack. I definitely would recommend this pillow!","purchase_model":"Size: Queen Size (2 pack) Color: Crescent White  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-02-17 15:48:11"},{"user":"Danielle Depina","content":"I purchased these pillows because I run hot at nighttime and have been unable to find a pillow that truly has a cooling effect.

I can\u2019t stand to have a crappy pillow. I\u2019ve purchased single pillows for double the cost of this 2-pack and have not been as happy as I am with these. They\u2019re PERFECTLY fluffy and the cooling side is legit cool. I\u2019m always skeptical of memory foam and whether it will give enough support but these give just the right amount of support and have the option to customize the amount of fill. I have no idea what the other reviews are talking about with the smell - I\u2019m pregnant and VERY sensitive to smells and these didn\u2019t bother me at all. I let them air out and fill up out of the shrink wrap packaging for several days before using and they\u2019ve been absolutely wonderful.
