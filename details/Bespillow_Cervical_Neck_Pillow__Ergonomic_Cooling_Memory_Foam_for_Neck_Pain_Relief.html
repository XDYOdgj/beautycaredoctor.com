			var commentsList = [{"user":"Jill Watson","content":"This is coming from a very picky person:I love this pillow, I was a little nervous to try one ordered online first, but the reviews looked good. So I ordered it. I tried it out for about 30 minutes and was a little worried it would make me feel sore that night. (I have had chronic neck tightness and pain + in my shoulders too, and going to a chiropractor to solve this. I noticed my old pillow was messing it up more so I needed a pillow to help) The first night trying this pillow, I fell asleep within 30 seconds of my head hitting the pillow. I woke up feeling like I slept so deeply. My old pillow caused me to wake up at least once a night due to discomfort. I did not wake up once the first night. However I did go to bed late so I waited until the next night to see if the results were the same. They were! I listen to a meditation every night and with my old pillow, it would ruin it because I would be constantly be trying to fix it. This one, I barely had to move and fell asleep before my guided meditation ended (5-10) minutes when I usually finish the whole thing (20 minutes). So this next night of sleep, I had gone to sleep on time, so this would be a good test. After falling asleep, again I did not wake up once. And woke up feeling like I slept deeply again! This pillow did not make my neck pain worse, I would say it improved! This pillow is also the perfect level of soft and firm. I don\u2019t like rock hard or too soft pillows. And the shape is good with the two sides to pick from. And it is good quality, holds up well, and seems like it will really last.Next, I want to mention I\u2019ve tried to be a back sleeper but struggled, always ended up on my stomach. But with this pillow I fell asleep easily and stayed asleep on my back! The neck and shoulder support are just so great, I will be able to keep a good posture if sleeping on my back. And still pretty good sleeping on my side too!For those worried about the aesthetic of the pillow on their bed, I just put a regular silk pillow case over it all and it looks mostly normal.For those worried about cooling effect ur seems that it stays pretty cool. I don\u2019t notice that factor too much though.It does have that weird memory foam smell at first, so let it air out. It\u2019s already diminished by the second night for me, I just take my extra pillow case off and let it breathe during the day.","purchase_model":"Color: Grey Color: Grey  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-02-07 15:48:11"},{"user":"Edward L","content":"I\u2019ve been sleeping for on expensive orthopedic pillows for years.For a variety of reasons, I still had neck pain, difficulty getting comfortable, and not sleeping though the night.So, I decided to take a chance and purchase the Bespillow10 pillow.I usually sleep on my sides but every now and then on my back.The first night using the Bespillow10, I decided to test the cervical characteristics of the pillow concerning a recent increase in neck pain and slept on my back.For the first time in years, I didn\u2019t thrash around in the bed trying to get comfortable, but simply stayed on my back and slept soundly through the night.I woke up the next morning refreshed and with absolutely no neck pain!I have been sleeping on this pillow for several nights now on each side and less frequently on my back.The results have been the same \u2013 great sleep and no neck pain at all.No matter what position I am in, I get great support with just the right amount of compliance from the structure of the pillow for a comfortable night sleep.This is quite remarkable since I have to use a CPAP for Sleep Apnea.Other pillows interfere with the mask causing me to wake up several time each night when the mask begins to leak.Not so with the Bespillow10.Although it is not advertised to be a CPAP pillow, the design and structure of this pillow places my face in a position that does not interfere with the mask.This is simply another great benefit of the Bespillow10.I realize that everyone has a different physical presence especially when we sleep.However, since my experiences using the Bespillow10 have revolutionized the quality of my sleep, I am confident that others may experience similar results.This is a remarkable pillow, and well worth the price.","purchase_model":"Color: Grey Color: Grey  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-11-27 15:48:11"},{"user":"Renee Sullivan","content":"My orthopedic surgeon told me THIS PILLOW is the BEST for supporting cervical spine (neck) issues! I had already started sleeping on it a month prior to having spinal fusion. Even those weeks prior to surgery I felt more rested and had more pain relief! I was surprised at how much a pillow could help! This pillow is worth the money! I use it every night!! The shape and firmness have not changed at all since I purchased this early this year! The pillow helped with my healing process following surgery as well. The great thing about the way this is built, you can use it either way\u2014either the wide or thinner side as they are both so comfortable!! I have cleaned the pillow following manufacturer\u2019s instructions and it smells fresh and clean after every use. Thank you for offering such a fabulous product! I will keep purchasing this pillow!","purchase_model":"Color: Blue Color: Blue  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-11-24 15:48:11"},{"user":"M","content":"This pillow was exactly what I was looking for. Memory foam pillows are always so hard, especially at first. This pillow is softer but still firm enough to do the job. I have been using it for a little over 20 days now and it really helps. I like that the pillow has dual options. One side is for when you are laying on your back and the other side is for when you're laying on your side.Quick tip that really helped me:If you're a back sleeper like I am, take a pillow and put it under your knees so your legs are slightly elevated & bent. I wish I would have done this sooner because it has really helped my neck and back feel better. It is important that you use a pillow between your legs/knees when you sleep on your side.","purchase_model":"Color: Grey Color: Grey  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-01-29 15:48:11"},{"user":"denise mcquade","content":"Great pillow, supportive pillow for your neck.

No matter what I try I cannot sleep on anything except my side. I have a special pillow but it was entirely too large for me to bring on this trip so I had to settle for something new. The pillow does stay pretty cool throughout the night and it's not too firm. Well the shape is a little weird I'm glad I bought the pillow case that fits it. The design is pretty interesting I didn't realize that I could either lay my wrist across the side of the pillow or sleep on my stomach if somehow I magically manage that. It's very comfortable. One thing I did notice is that as my opposite shoulder relaxes they tend to cave in together, causing pain in my traps in the morning. By using a regular pillow in front of my chest to throw my arm across, my chest and shoulders don't sink causing pain in the morning. I enjoy this pillow.","purchase_model":"Color: Grey Color: Grey  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-12-28 15:48:11"},{"user":"Charliene Wilson","content":"This pillow has helped my 16yo daughter so much in such a short time that I can't give it any less than 5 stars. We bought one for us both to try out and see if we should buy another. She tried it first and for the first time in years woke up without pain. The result held true for the 2nd and 3rd nights. When I took a turn to try it out, sure enough, she awoke with pain again and limited neck movement. So, I am not able to give it a few night's try myself, as the result for my daughter is so drastic I cannot leave her without the pillow! lol I am now buying one for myself without having been able to fully try it first. The packaging it came in was lacking and there were no instructions of any sort, so we had to come back to Amazon to figure out which side to use for which kind of sleeping. But the product itself seems to be outstanding.","purchase_model":"Color: Grey Color: Grey  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-01-10 15:48:11"},{"user":"Amazon Customer","content":"I'mshort 5.1 so this pillow is not as thick and it cradles my neck.
