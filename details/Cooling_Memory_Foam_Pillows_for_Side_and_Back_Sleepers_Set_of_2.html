These pillows are hands down the best for me. They are both hard and soft, can be used to prop myself up to watch TV, or pass out on them with no weird neck positions.

You can add or remove the memory foam as desired; I took some from one and added it to another, so I had a \"bigger\" and 'smaller' option. If you like firm pillows, this brand is a sure win.

I recommend giving them 8+hours to reach their full poofed size.They do come with a cover that I washed before using the pillow, as well as a pillow case on it. The zippers on both the pillow and the cover were intact, no issues zipping.Overall, very happy and will continue to buy these as needed or for gifts as my mom wanted to steal one and only gave it back when I promised I'll buy her some for her house!","purchase_model":"Size: Queen (Pack of 2) Color: White  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-08-11 15:48:11"},{"user":"Amazon Customer","content":"My son had these at his home and I loved them and purchased a set for myself.They did have a slight odor but no longer.I love these pillows.They are very comfortable and good quality.","purchase_model":"Size: King (Pack of 2) Color: White  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-11-09 15:48:11"}];
