The first pillows i had bought were amazing, but after they wore out i struggled to find new ones that were as good. They either seemed to be way to big, causing my neck to hurt in the morning, or they flattened out over time (i expect a bit of this but not quickly). This pillow i bought to be honest because it was cheap and the reviews were good. I had low hopes, but i figured if it wasn't good at least it was cheap. I was pleasantly surprised by how strong it was. It holds it shape even after using it for a long period of time. And it remains cool to the touch which is nice on hot summer nights. This is my new favorite pillow, and i am going to get them for everyone in the house.",

			var commentsList = [{"user":"Josephine","content":"I purchased 4 of these purple pillows. I needed new pillows so I thought I\u2019d give these a try. After unpacking and letting air out for a couple of days I had no issues withchemical smells. First few nights I was seriously thinking of returning these pillows. I felt they were a little to hard on my neck and shoulder area but I did notice I wasn\u2019t waking in the middle of the night to fluff up the pillows under my neck like I did with the old pillows. I love my books and enjoy reading in bed most nights and these pillows are perfect prop up pillows for my back when sitting up in bed reading. Still a little different for sleeping but my body is adjusting. I\u2019ve had these pillows for about a month now and wouldn\u2019t trade them for standard pillows ever again. My body has adjusted to these pillows perfectly. It just takes time. I would recommend these pillows but would want anyone thinking of purchasing these pillows to know that you need to give your body time to adjust to the change. I now love these pillows no matter how I sleep. Side sleep - on my back - on my stomach - propped up reading. It\u2019s all good and I\u2019m happy I made the purchase.UPDATE - It\u2019s been about 5 or 6 months and I\u2019m happy to say I LOVE THESE PILLOWS. I look forward to going to bed at night knowing I\u2019m going to fall into sweet slumber on these pillows. I now have 6 of these purplepillows on my bed. One of the highlights of my day is knowing I get to sink myself into sweet perfection. I no longer wake up with back pain and feel very rested by morning. I highly recommend these pillows. ????????????","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-02-12 15:48:11"},{"user":"J Ogilbee","content":"These Foam Pillows are a must-have for our RV camping trips! They\u2019re super comfy, providing great support while keeping cool with the ventilated foam. I love that the cooling feature keeps us comfortable on warm Florida nights, which is especially important when camping in the summer. The memory foam provides just the right amount of support for my neck and head, helping me sleep soundly no matter the conditions.They\u2019re compact enough to fit perfectly in our RV, and they\u2019re great for relaxing or reading in bed. The 2-pack is ideal for us, and the pillows don\u2019t take up too much space, making them perfect for RV storage.

I'm a side sleeper mostly so it works great for me. It's one block of memory foam too it's not a pillow where you can take out foam pieces to make smaller or bigger (nectar pillows are like that).

I used a very expensive \u201cnatural coconut\u201d pillow for about 6 years. It was becoming too soft and I also made the mistake of washing the pillow in the wash machine and it ended up cracking down the middle. It was hard to part with but this pillow has made it so easy. For the price, compared to my last one, I\u2019d be happy if it lasted a year. It\u2019s super lightweight but firm. The spandex case is very slippery tho.

It is wonderful! I immediately noticed the pain in my neck leave. I\u2019ve had a cramp between my shoulder blades from sleeping on my side and this pillow fixed that too.

I have used memory foam pillows for over a decade. The first pillows i had bought were amazing, but after they wore out i struggled to find new ones that were as good. They either seemed to be way to big, causing my neck to hurt in the morning, or they flattened out over time (i expect a bit of this but not quickly). This pillow i bought to be honest because it was cheap and the reviews were good. I had low hopes, but i figured if it wasn't good at least it was cheap. I was pleasantly surprised by how strong it was. It holds it shape even after using it for a long period of time. And it remains cool to the touch which is nice on hot summer nights. This is my new favorite pillow, and i am going to get them for everyone in the house.","purchase_model":"Size: 1 pack Color: Lilac Dreamer  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-12-04 15:48:11"}];
