I'm not a fan of memory foam so I was skeptical, but this pillow has the perfect amount of give to provide support in all the right places. I haven't slept this well in years.I've only had it for a couple of weeks, so I can't speak to it's durability, but first impressions are awesome. If you're unsure, $32 is a pretty small gamble.",

It arrived on time and undamaged. The pillow came rolled up but quickly expanded to its nornal size and thickness. I am happy to say this is a very comfortable and suppprtive pillow. I have experienced pain relief and discomfort relief since day one. I can honestly say that since I started sleeping with it, I wake up easier, faster, and better rested. Also, as funny as it may sound, my head sweats less since the pillow maintains a cool temperature. Moreover, I appreciate that each end of the pillow is a different height/thickness so you can choose yhe side that suits you better.

Highly recommend.","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-12-20 15:48:11"},{"user":"Amazon Customer","content":"I don\u2019t leave reviews but after going through probably 50+ pillows ($$$$) in the last 7-10 years, I had a great nights sleep last night, better than I\u2019ve had in 10 years. I was skeptical but hopeful. When I first laid down for bed I thought \u201coh no, another hard/firm pillow that will hurts my ears, shoulders and neck\u201d. Within seconds my head sank in and to my surprise I was in pure comfort. It supports the head and neck and my shoulders were not in pain. I laid on my back and then my other side and all positions are insanely comfortable and supported. When changing positions it feels firm at first but 3-5 seconds later you melt into this pillow and it\u2019s awesome.I was using a Casper pillow but I noticed if I put my hand to the back of my neck there was a huge void there, straining my neck which leads to shoulder and back pain. This pillow cradles that void and I have complete support. It\u2019s not a hot pillow either, never sweat or felt it was radiating my body heat. After trying so many pillows through the years, I\u2019m optimistic and hopeful about this one. That\u2019s why I left this review. One pillow doesn\u2019t fit all people, you have to find the one that does. What works for you may not work for me.

After spending tons of money over the past 6 yrs on pillows that say they relieve neck pain (and they don't) this pillow for $35 actually works. This is not a paid review! I am telling you the God's honest truth. This pillow works for me & probably will for you too. I am a side sleeper. Anyone who is a side sleeper knows how much pillows designed for us cost. They can be upwards of $80 & up. $35 is all it took to relieve my neck pain. The design of the curvature is what works. Please don't waste your money on expensive pillows, try this one first if you are experiencing neck pain. It's sooooworth it! I didn't notice any funky smells when I opened it. As far as cooling, in my experience once you put a pillow case on any cooling pillow, its no longer cooling any more! But who cares if you wake up with no neck pain!

The pain relief since using this pillow I'd more than I hoped for.This is a great value!Not too expensive!And well worth the price!
